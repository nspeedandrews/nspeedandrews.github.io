				<h3>About me:</h3>
				<p>I am a South African 19-year-old student currently completing my 1st year of Business Science, Finance with Accounting at the University of Cape Town. I am an extrovert and thrive on interacting with people and making new connections. I am a sport fanatic - mainly focusing on diving, hockey, swimming and running. I am an eager learner and always up for new challenges. I hope to be able to motivate all those around me, and put the words of all those who have inspired me into practice.</p>

				<h3>Family:</h3>
				<p>I am a family of 4: my father is a qualified chartered accountant and mother is a self-employed Interior Decorator and my brother is in high school. I come from Afrikaans and British heritage. My dad, however, was diagnosed with early onset Alzheimerâ€™s disease 2 years ago. This lead to large changes in our lifestyle, and he is currently living in the UK with the rest of his family. </p>

				<h3>Education:</h3>
				I attended
				<a href="http://kingsmead.co.za">Kingsmead College</a>
				for primary school and high school, which in part shaped me into the person I am today. I participated in every sport our school had to offer, which allowed me to pursue at a provincial level in diving and hockey. Doing sport at this level has shown me the true meaning of persistence, teamwork and time management. As stated, I am a student at the
				<a href="https://www.uct.ac.za">University of Cape Town</a> 
				studying towards being a Chartered Accountant, as the possibilities of what I can do with the degree are endless and I believe it will pose enough challenges for me in life.
